            <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
            Although COSYNE Brainhack is not associated with the main COSYNE conference, we follow an adapted
            version of the COSYNE Code of Conduct, except with different contact information and adjustments for
            our different scopes.

            <h3>PURPOSE</h3>
            <p>
            At COSYNE Brainhack, we strive for open and honest intellectual debate as part of a welcoming and inclusive
            atmosphere. This requires a community and an environment that recognizes and respects the
            inherent worth of every person.
            </p>
            <h3>SOURCES</h3>
            <p>
              This code of conduct is based on standards and language set at other meetings, whose organizing
              boards convened special working groups of scientific and legal experts to set their policies. We
              follow, in particular, those guidelines established for the Gordon Research Conferences, the
              Society for Neuroscience Annual Meeting, and NeurIPS.
            </p>
            <p>
              The following code of conduct has been adapted from:

            <h3>RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
            <p>
            All participants, volunteers, organizers, reviewers, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers (referred
            to as “Participants” collectively throughout this document) at COSYNE Brainhack---
            are required to agree with this Code of Conduct both
            during an event and on official communication channels, including social media.
            Sponsors are equally subject to this Code of Conduct. In particular, sponsors should not use
            images, activities, or other materials that are of a sexual, racial, or otherwise offensive nature.
            This code applies both to official sponsors as well as any organization that uses the COSYNE Brainhack
            name as branding as part of its activities at or around COSYNE Brainhack.
            </p>
            <p>
            Organizers will enforce this Code, and it is expected that all Participants will cooperate to help
            ensure a safe and inclusive environment for everyone.
            </p>
            <h3>POLICY</h3>
            <p>
              The conference commits itself to providing an experience for all Participants that is free from the

                    <li>“Zoom bombing” or any virtual activity that is not related to the topic of discussion
                    which detracts from the topic or the purpose of the program. This includes

                    presenters/monitors/event leaders. </li>

            </p>
            <p>
            This Code of Conduct applies to the actual meeting sites and venues where COSYNE Brainhack
            business is being conducted, including physical venues, online venues, and official virtual
            engagement platforms, including video, virtual streaming, and chat-based interactions. COSYNE Brainhack
            is not responsible for non-sponsored activity or behavior that may occur at non-sponsored
            locations such as hotels, restaurants, or physical or virtual locations not otherwise a sanctioned
            space for sponsored events. Nonetheless, any issues brought to the Organizers will be explored.
            Moreover, COSYNE Brainhack will not actively monitor social media platforms
            but will follow up on issues of harassment and violations of the code of conduct that occur on
            those platforms that are specifically related to the COSYNE Brainhack program, during the course of
            COSYNE Brainhack, if and when they are brought to our attention.
            </p>
            <h3>COMPLAINT REPORTING</h3>
            <p>
            The Conference encourages all Participants to immediately report any incidents of discrimination,
            harassment, unprofessional conduct, and/or retaliation so that complaints can be quickly and fairly
            resolved. There will be no retaliation against any Participant who brings a complaint or submits
            an incident report in good faith or who honestly assists in investigating such a complaint. If you
            have concerns related to your participation/interaction at COSYNE Brainhack or COSYNE Brainhack
            sanctioned events, or observe someone else's difficulties, or have any other concerns you wish
            to share, please write to brainhack.cosyne@gmail.com.
            </p>
            <h3>ACTION</h3>
            <p>
            If a Participant engages in any inappropriate behavior as defined herein, the COSYNE Brainhack
            Organizers may take action as deemed appropriate, including: a formal or informal warning to the
            offender, expulsion from the event, barring from participation in future
            events or their organization, reporting the incident to the offender's local institution or
            funding agencies, or reporting the incident to local authorities or law enforcement. A response of
            "just joking" is not acceptable. If action is taken, an appeals process will be made available. There
            will be no retaliation against any Participant who brings a complaint or submits an incident report
            in good faith or who honestly assists in investigating such a complaint. All issues brought forth to
            the COSYNE Brainhack Organizers during the course of the event will be immediately investigated.
