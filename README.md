## Getting Started

Node.JS 18.17+ or later is required.

You can install `nodejs` and `yarn` globally on your computer. Or to install those in an isolated environment,
you can create a conda environment and install `nodejs` and `yarn` from conda-forge.

On first load of the repository or if the dependencies change, run:

```bash
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:9009](http://localhost:9009) with your browser to see the result.
