# 2024 Pre-COSYNE Brainhack Project handbook

## Project submission

You can submit a project [here](https://github.com/pre-cosyne-brainhack/hackathon2024/issues/new?assignees=octocat&labels=Hackathon+Project&projects=&template=hackathon-project-form.yml&title=%3CMy+Project+Name%3E).

We will ask you to provide some information about your project in order to advertise it and help onboarding new members.

If you have any questions on the way of submitting your project, feel free to open a general issue to ask.


This handbook includes more information on each item.

### Link to project

If your project involves code, we recommend using a public repository (e.g. GitHub).

If your project does not involve coding, please include a link to the relevant documentation
(e.g., shared online document, space on the open science framework, etc.).

The repository should have a [README.md](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/opening-your-project/write-a-great-project-readme/) containing:
-   project idea and context;
-   installation guidelines if applicable;
-   links to further reading/tutorials;
-   and if you want, additional files such as [Contributors.md](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/), to specify which types of people can contribute how.

### Goals

Try to describe what you want to achieve during this Brainhack.

If your project is just starting, it might simply be "discuss, set up a roadmap, and identify potential obstacles".

For some other projects it could be a set of **SMART** goals:
-   Specific (simple, sensible, significant).
-   Measurable (meaningful, motivating).
-   Achievable (agreed, attainable).
-   Relevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based).
-   Time bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive).

### Good first issues

If you have set up a repository for your code, it would be great if you open at least 1 `good first issues`
issues that describe the goals you would like to achieve in this Brainhack.

Some examples:
-   improve documentation or tutorial for a package
-   fix an easy bug
-   add tests for specific features

### Onboarding: skills

List skills that would be particularly suitable for your project. Skills can include coding skills and non-coding skills.

#### Non-coding skills

Think in particular about what different types of contributions could be?

It is not all about coding! Are you interested in collaborating with someone with a good flair for
good visualization? Someone with more experience who can make a good user interface? Someone who
knows how to develop good, tidy and clear documentation?

### Credit and onboarding

How would your project onboard new members with different skillsets -- physicist/imager/clinician/psychologist/computational
scientist/maker/artist/lawyer -- as a project collaborator?

We recommend that you read through Mozilla Open Leadership material on
[personas](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/bring-on-contributors-using-personas-and-pathways/) and [contribution guidelines](https://mozilla.github.io/open-leadership-training-series/articles/building-communities-of-contributors/write-contributor-guidelines/).

If you want to easily list contributors on your repository you can look into the [all contributors bot](https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors-bot).
